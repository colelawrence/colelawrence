### ðŸ‘‹ My name is Cole Lawrence,

I design, test, and guide the implementation of end-user programming tools. (he/him)

> I believe that people willing to teach should be able to easily empower everyone to build new digital tools and apps without barriers.

The largest problems with the current tools that block us from making this kind of progress include poor collaboration primitives.
I shouldn't have to follow your read-only screen share on a second monitor in order to learn to do something. We should both be able to exist in one space with shared control for what we're working on with dialogs and all. If you say, "right click" this and open a menu, I should see your dropdown menu on my side, too, and be able to choose an item from the list you opened.
